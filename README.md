# artful-draw

Create an app that shows a full screen drawing canvas.

I should be able to select colors and brush sizes from horizontal swatches across the bottom of the screen. Show which one is active, by default select black and a thick brush, and paint with a round shape.

Use the famous Mondrian color palette for the colors.
